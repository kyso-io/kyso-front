# Governance

## Overview

This project is led by the project leads and managed by the community. That is, the community actively contributes to the day-to-day maintenance of the project, but the project leads draw the general strategic line. In case of disagreement, they have the last word. It is the project leads' job to resolve disputes within the community and ensure that the project can progress in a coordinated way. In turn, it is the community's job to guide the decisions of the project leads through active engagement and contribution.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Project Leads

Fran Barrera - [@fran-kyso](https://github.com/fran-kyso) (Full-stack Engineer), Helena Domo - [@helenadm](https://github.com/helenadm) (Frontend Engineer), and Kyle O'Shea - [@KyleOS](https://github.com/KyleOS) (product decision maker), the founders of the Kyso open-source project, serve as leads. In case of disagreement within the leadership team, decisions will be made by a majority vote.

The project leads have the final say in all aspects of decision-making within the project. However, because the community always has the ability to fork, this team is fully answerable to the community. It is the project leads' responsibility to set the strategic objectives of the project and communicate these clearly to the community. They also have to understand the community as a whole and strive to satisfy as many conflicting needs as possible while ensuring that the project survives in the long term.

In many ways, the role of the project leads are diplomacy. The key is to ensure that, as the project expands, the right people are given influence over it, and the community rallies behind the vision of the project leads. The leads' job is to ensure that the founders' team and the core team members (see below) make the right decisions on behalf of the project. Generally speaking, as long as the founders' teams and the core team members are aligned with the project's strategy, the project leads will allow them to proceed as they desire.

### The Founding Team

The team members who co-founded Kyso are the original contributors responsible for its creation before the application became an open-source project. Thanks to their contributions, Kyso is an enterprise-ready system readily available for the open source community. Members of the Founding Team will continue to lead the project moving forward at their own discretion, or as & when assistance is requested by the Project Leads.

While the Founding Team members have authority over the general direction of the project, the Project Leads have the final say on any critical decisions. It is the Founding Team members' responsibility to ensure the project's long-term health and that it functions flawlessly for user deployments.

The members of the Founding Team (excl. the Project Leads) are: Elena Rueda - @, Daniel And√∫jar - @danielandujarlorenzo, Sergio Talens-Oliag - @sto, Eoin Murray - @eoinmurray

### The Core Team

Members of the core team are contributors who have made multiple valuable contributions to the project and are now relied upon to both write code directly to the repository and screen the contributions of others. In many cases, they are programmers, but it is also possible that they contribute in a different role, for example, community engagement. Typically, a core team member will focus on a specific aspect of the project, and will bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the project lead. The role of core team member is not an official one, it is simply a position that influential members of the community will find themselves in as the Project Leads look to them for guidance and support.

Core team members have no authority over the overall direction of the project. However, they do have the ear of the Project Leads. It is a core team member's job to ensure that the Leads are aware of the community's needs and collective objectives and to help develop or elicit appropriate contributions to the project. Often, core team members are given informal control over their specific areas of responsibility and are assigned rights to directly modify certain areas of the source code. That is, although core team members do not have explicit decision-making authority, they will often find that their actions are synonymous with the decisions made by the Leads.

### Active Core Team Members

Active Core Team Members contribute to the project on a regular basis. An active core team member usually has one or more focus areas - in the most common cases, they will be responsible for regular issue triaging, bug fixing, documentation improvements or feature development in a sub-project repository.

### Core Team Emeriti

Some core team members who have made valuable contributions in the past may no longer be able to commit to the same level of participation today due to various reasons. That is perfectly normal, and any past contributions to the project are still highly appreciated. These core team members are honoured for their contributions as Core Team Emeriti, and are welcome to resume active participation at any time.

### Contributors

Contributors are community members make valuable contributions, such as those outlined in the list below, but generally do not have the authority to make direct changes to the project code. Contributors engage with the project through communication tools, such as the request for comments (RFC) discussion, Github issues and pull requests, and suggesting new features.

Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, specific skill requirements or selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.

Some contributors will already be engaging with the project as users, but will also find themselves doing one or more of the following:

- Supporting new users
- Reporting bugs
- Identifying requirements
- Supplying graphics and web design
- Programming
- Assisting with project infrastructure
- Writing documentation
- Fixing bugs
- Adding features

As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, they may find that the Project Leads start relying on them more and more. When this begins to happen, they gradually adopt the role of core team member, as described above.

### Users

Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the community: without them, the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no specific requirements.

Users should be encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. Common user activities include (but are not limited to):

- evangelising the project
- informing developers of project strengths and weaknesses from a new user's perspective
- providing moral support (a 'thank you' goes a long way)
- providing financial support

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find themselves becoming more and more involved. Such users may then go on to become contributors, as described above.

## Decision-Making Process

Major changes to the framework, especially breaking changes, are usually communicated ahead of time to the community via the RFC process. The RFC process provides an opportunity for the community to provide feedback in the design process, and allow the project leads and core team members to better gauge user needs.

However, it is important to note that the RFC process does not hold any authority in decision-making. In case of disagreements, the Project Leads do not need a formal conflict resolution process since their word is final. Suppose the community chooses to question the wisdom of the actions of a core team member. In that case, the Project Leads can review their decisions by checking the relevant GitHub discussions and either uphold or reverse them.

## Contribution Process

Anyone can contribute to the project, regardless of their skills, as there are many ways to contribute. For instance, a contributor might be active in the project discussions, comments, and issue tracker or supply pull requests. All forms of contribution must be performed in accordance to the project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kyso-io/kyso-front/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This governance document serves as a foundation for Kyso's community. We encourage all contributors and community members to familiarise themselves with these guidelines to ensure a collaborative and productive environment. Thank you for your commitment to our project!
