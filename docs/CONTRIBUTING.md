## 1. Creating Good Issues

When creating an issue for Kyso, please follow these guidelines to help us understand and address the problem or feature request effectively:

1. **Use Descriptive Titles**: Provide a clear and concise title that summarizes the issue or feature request.
2. **Detailed Description**: In the issue description, provide detailed information about the problem or feature request. Include any relevant context, error messages, or steps to reproduce the issue.
3. **Labels and Milestones**: [labels](https://github.com/kyso-io/kyso-front/blob/develop/doc/labels.md) Assign appropriate labels and milestones to the issue to categorize it correctly. This helps us prioritize and organize our work.
4. **Search for Duplicates**: Before creating a new issue, please search for existing issues to avoid duplicates. If you find a similar issue, you can comment and provide additional information if needed.
5. **Code of Conduct**: Always adhere to ourÂ [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kyso-io/kyso-front/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)Â when interacting on the issue tracker. Be respectful and considerate of others.

## 2. **Collaborating effectively**

### Create a new issue.

If you spot a problem with the docs,Â [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/kyso-io/kyso-front/issues).Â If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

### Solve an issue

Scan through ourÂ [existing issues](https://github.com/kyso-io/kyso-front/issues)Â to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. SeeÂ [Labels](https://github.com/kyso-io/kyso-front/blob/develop/doc/labels.md)Â for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make changes in the UI

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Kyso will generally not be accepted.

**New features**

- Suggest your change in theÂ [kyso mail list](https://github.com/kyso-io/kyso-front/blob/develop/doc/mail-list.md) Â and start writing code.
- Only open an issue on GitHub once you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.
- We generally reject changes to the core extensions.
- Be understanding of our lack of support.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget toÂ self-review to speed up the review processâš¡.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Remember to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow mainter edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you encounter any merge issues, check out thisÂ [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts)Â to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!
