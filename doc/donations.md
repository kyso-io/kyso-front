# Donations

Donations are crucial for supporting open-source projects, allowing them to thrive and grow. They ensure the support of our maintainer's members and help us allocate funds to contributors or teams based on their merit, expertise, and commitment to the project's values. This helps them prioritize projects, features, or initiatives that align with the project's goals. However, please note that donations do not guarantee that feature requests, bug fixes, or improvements will be completed. It is important to have complete information about the project and its scope before making a donation.

Donations keep this project alive.

Thank you,
The Kyso team.
